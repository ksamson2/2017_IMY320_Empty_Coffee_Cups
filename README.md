Phase 1: 
Introduction

For this project, we have been tasked with creating an interactive, advertising website for the game we are developing for IMY 300. The game is a 3D low poly survival game and consists of three levels. We plan to incorporate several of the design trends that have been taught in class. The website will be designed and crafted to maximise good UX design patterns and trends. All content generated for the website will be created by us for the intents of this project. This is our proposed design: 
Website Organisation
The website will consist out of these pages:
●	Home page
●	About page
●	Character page
●	Biomes page
●	Creatures page
Preliminary Design
Color Palette
 
We chose darker greys and black to correlate with the trend of darker colours and red for the trend of vivid colors to contrast the darker ones. This is just our preliminary palette. We plan to have a few more tones of beige, and some earthy greens to match the colors that are predominant in our game. 
Home Page
 
This will be the first thing the user sees when they have opened the website. It makes use of web trends such as the large and geometric, block font and the dark colour palette. The design consists out of 4 blocks on a black background, each block becomes a slightly lighter shade of grey until the front block is white. The blocks will move around in small circular motions to show signs of life.
 
This is what the user will see when they hover their mouse cursor over any of the moving grey blocks. The block will come forward through the other blocks and will display the appropriate heading on top of a screenshot that is relevant to the section. The other blocks will work the same way but the screenshots will be different as well as the placement and size of the font.
 
 
 
About Page / Character Page

 
The main character page will attempt to keep the rest of the sites off-center asymmetry. With elements such as the player icon falling off the background block in line with the current trend of asymmetry. The title text would be large relative to the body and other elements.
  

The Main Character text will be the first to animate onto the screen with a hover effect that flips the heading. 
 
The player icon will slide on screen from the left and will scale up when hovered over. When clicked the image will change displaying in game images of the main character.
 
The body copy will be the last to slide in and will not include any further effects or animations.

Biomes / Creatures Page
 
The creatures and biomes pages will be designed similarly. We chose red as a bold contrast to the black. This serves to link with the vivid color trend, also red is a predominant hue in level one of the game which is a desert. We used the polygon block as a background to the wolf to add a rich background and the style of the game is low poly. It’s beige to match the idea of level one being a desert. We’ve used the two-thirds placement to create an asymmetrical look. The heading “desert fox” will animate in. The individual links in the navigation are animated when hovered over. The text “lorem” on the side will rotate when hovered over and expand when clicked on:
